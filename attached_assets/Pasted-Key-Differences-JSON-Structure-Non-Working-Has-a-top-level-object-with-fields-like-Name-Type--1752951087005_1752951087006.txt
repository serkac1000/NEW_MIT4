Key Differences:

JSON Structure:
Non-Working: Has a top-level object with fields like $Name, $Type, $Version, authURL, YaVersion, Source, and a nested Properties object that repeats some fields and includes $Components.
Working: Places all fields directly under the $JSON section, with no redundant top-level fields outside the Properties object.
Issue: The extra nesting in the non-working file (e.g., $Name, $Type, $Version outside Properties) may cause the parser to fail, as it expects the JSON to start with authURL, YaVersion, Source, and Properties directly.
Properties:
Non-Working: Includes additional properties like AlignHorizontal: 3, AlignVertical: 2, BackgroundColor: -3355444, and more components (StatusLabel, ResetButton).
Working: Simpler, with fewer properties (e.g., ActionBar: "True") and only two components.
Issue: The additional properties and components are valid but increase complexity. The parser should handle them unless they violate specific constraints (e.g., invalid values).
Delimiter Case:
Non-Working: Uses #|$JSON (uppercase JSON).
Working: Uses $JSON (mixed case in the working file’s context).
Issue: The parser may be case-sensitive and expect $JSON exactly, though this is unlikely to be the sole cause.
Root Cause
The most likely cause of the error is the nested JSON structure in the non-working Screen1.scm. The redundant top-level fields ($Name, $Type, $Version) outside the Properties object deviate from the expected format, as seen in the working file. The parser may be looking for a specific structure starting with authURL, YaVersion, Source, and Properties, and the extra nesting confuses it, leading to the failure to locate the $JSON section. Other potential issues include file encoding, subtle formatting errors, or incorrect directory structure in the .aia.

Steps to Fix
Fix JSON Structure in Screen1.scm:
Remove the redundant top-level fields and move all properties into the Properties object, matching the working file’s structure. Here’s the corrected version:

System: The error java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to parse file - cannot locate beginning of $JSON section when uploading the non-working .aia file is likely caused by the incorrect JSON structure in the Screen1.scm file. Specifically, the non-working file has redundant top-level fields ($Name, $Type, $Version) outside the Properties object, which deviates from the expected format seen in the working file. MIT App Inventor's parser expects a specific structure starting with authURL, YaVersion, Source, and Properties, and the extra nesting likely prevents it from locating the $JSON section correctly.

Recommended Fix for Screen1.scm
Modify the Screen1.scm file to match the working file’s structure by removing the redundant top-level fields and ensuring all properties are within the Properties object. Here’s the corrected version:

Additional Steps
Verify File Encoding:
Ensure Screen1.scm is saved in UTF-8 without BOM encoding. Use a text editor like Notepad++ or VS Code to check and convert if necessary.
Check Directory Structure:
Confirm the file is placed in the correct path within the .aia (e.g., src/appinventor/ai_{username}/ButtonApp/Screen1.scm). The main field in project.properties should match the path (e.g., main=appinventor.ai_{your_username}.ButtonApp.Screen1).
Update project.properties:
Ensure the project.properties file includes all required fields, as previously suggested:

Replace {your_username} with your MIT App Inventor account username.
Repackage the .aia:
Extract the non-working .aia as a .zip.
Replace Screen1.scm and project.properties with the corrected versions.
Ensure the directory structure is correct (e.g., youngandroidproject/project.properties, src/appinventor/ai_{username}/ButtonApp/Screen1.scm).
Re-zip the folder and rename it to .aia.
Upload the new .aia to ai2.appinventor.mit.edu.
Test with a New Project:
If the upload fails, create a new MIT App Inventor project with the same components (Button1, Button2, StatusLabel, ResetButton) and settings (e.g., AlignHorizontal: 3, AlignVertical: 2). Export it as an .aia and compare its files to confirm the correct structure. Transfer any unique assets or settings manually.
Check Server and Browser:
Use ai2.appinventor.mit.edu with Chrome (version 138.0.0.0, which is recent as of July 2025).
Clear browser cache or try Firefox/Edge if issues persist.
Community Support:
If the error persists, share the modified .aia (with sensitive data removed) on the MIT App Inventor Community forum (community.appinventor.mit.edu). Include the error message, file creation details, and directory structure.
Notes
The Screen1.bky file ({"blocks": []}) is likely fine, as it indicates no blocks are defined, similar to the working file’s empty Screen1.bky.
If the .aia was created with an older MIT App Inventor version or third-party tool, recreating it in the current version may be necessary.
