Steps to Fix the Non-Working .aia
Reformat Screen1.scm:
Minify the JSON in Screen1.scm to a single line, matching the working file’s format. For example:
plaintext



#|$JSON
{"$Name":"Screen1","$Type":"Form","$Version":"31","authURL":["ai2.appinventor.mit.edu"],"YaVersion":"232","Source":"Form","Properties":{"$Name":"Screen1","$Type":"Form","$Version":"31","Title":"12 Button App","Uuid":"0","AppName":"ButtonApp","AlignHorizontal":3,"AlignVertical":2,"BackgroundColor":-3355444,"$Components":[{"$Name":"Button1","$Type":"Button","$Version":"7","Text":"Button 1","WidthPercent":80,"Height":50,"BackgroundColor":-16776961,"TextColor":-1,"FontSize":16,"Uuid":"1354119314"},{"$Name":"Button2","$Type":"Button","$Version":"7","Text":"Button 2","WidthPercent":80,"Height":50,"BackgroundColor":-16776961,"TextColor":-1,"FontSize":16,"Uuid":"-351954681"},{"$Name":"StatusLabel","$Type":"Label","$Version":"7","Text":"No button clicked yet","Width":-2,"FontSize":18,"TextAlignment":1,"Uuid":"123456789"},{"$Name":"ResetButton","$Type":"Button","$Version":"7","Text":"Reset","WidthPercent":80,"Height":50,"BackgroundColor":-16776961,"TextColor":-1,"FontSize":16,"Uuid":"987654321"}]}}

Add missing fields like authURL, YaVersion, and Source, and update $Version to 31. Assign unique Uuids to components (e.g., random numbers like 123456789 for StatusLabel and 987654321 for ResetButton).
Update project.properties:
Replace the placeholder name={project_name} with a valid name (e.g., name=ButtonApp).
Add required fields from the working file, such as:
plaintext

Replace {your_username} with your MIT App Inventor account username or a unique identifier.
Repackage the .aia:
Extract the non-working .aia as a .zip file.
Replace the modified Screen1.scm and project.properties files in the appropriate directories (e.g., youngandroidproject/project.properties and src/appinventor/ai_{username}/ButtonApp/Screen1.scm).
Re-zip the folder and rename it to .aia.
Try uploading the new .aia file to MIT App Inventor.
Test with a New Project:
If the above fails, create a new project in MIT App Inventor with the same components (Button1, Button2, StatusLabel, ResetButton) and settings (e.g., AlignHorizontal, AlignVertical, colors). Export it as an .aia file and compare its Screen1.scm and project.properties to ensure compatibility. Then, manually transfer any unique assets or settings from the non-working file.
Check Server Compatibility:
Ensure you’re using the latest MIT App Inventor instance (ai2.appinventor.mit.edu). If the non-working file was created with an older or offline version, it may need to be recreated in the current version.
Community Support:
If the file still fails to upload, share the modified .aia (or a minimal version with sensitive data removed) on the MIT App Inventor Community forum (community.appinventor.mit.edu). Include the error message and details about how the file was created.
Additional Notes
The non-working file’s Screen1.bky with {"blocks": []} is likely fine, as it indicates no blocks are defined. You don’t need to modify it unless you haveross
System: The issue with the non-working .aia file is primarily due to the Screen1.scm file's JSON formatting and content issues. The non-working file uses a multi-line, human-readable JSON format, an outdated version ($Version: 27), missing fields like authURL and Source, and a potentially invalid Uuid. These factors likely cause the java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to parse file - cannot locate beginning of $JSON section error, as MIT App Inventor's parser expects a minified, single-line JSON with specific fields and current versioning (e.g., $Version: 31, YaVersion: 232).

Recommended Fix
Minify JSON in Screen1.scm:
Convert the JSON to a single-line format, as shown in the working file. For example:
plaintext

Add missing fields: "authURL":["ai2.appinventor.mit.edu"], "YaVersion":"232", "Source":"Form".
Update "$Version":"31" for the Form and "$Version":"7" for components.
Use unique, server-like Uuids (e.g., "1354119314", "-351954681", etc.).
Update project.properties:
Replace name={project_name} with a valid name (e.g., name=ButtonApp).
Add missing fields to match the working file:
